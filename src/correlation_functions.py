def calc_corr_weighted(meas_pair_lists: tuple[list[Meas], list[Meas]]) -> tuple:
    """
    Calculates the weighted Pearson correlation coefficient and combines p-values for each pair of 
    Meas objects from two lists, based on their interpolated signals. Handles trimming, 
    validating, interpolating, and merging of the signals.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    meas_pair_lists : tuple[list[Meas], list[Meas]]
        A tuple containing two lists of Meas objects, where each list corresponds to one person in the pair.
        Each list will be iterated to compute correlations between all possible combinations of the Meas objects.

    Returns:
    --------
    tuple:
        - avg_corr (float): The weighted average of the Fisher-transformed Pearson correlation coefficients.
        - combined_p_val (float): The combined p-value derived using Fisher's method.
        - shift_diff (float): The difference in shift values from the metadata of the two Meas objects.
        - meas1_name (str): String representation of the first Meas object in the pair.
        - meas2_name (str): String representation of the second Meas object in the pair.
        - merged_meas1 (Meas): Meas object from the interpolated and combined signals from input lists.
        - merged_meas2 (Meas): Meas object from the interpolated and combined signals from input lists.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If no valid correlations are computed, the function will return `(None, None)`.
    - The weighted average correlation is calculated based on the length of the interpolated signals as weights.
    - P-values are combined using Fisherâ€™s method via `combine_pvalues`.
